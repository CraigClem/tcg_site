#### Since the start of this year, The Coders Guild has been providing free digital skills training in web and app development, UX, and software testing for 135 learners here in Yorkshire.

These training courses are part of an innovative project led by West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) and the Department for Education, following a £2.5 billion investment into the National Skills Fund. 

Today, we're incredibly proud to congratulate all those 135 participants for completing their training, marking their successful graduation from these bootcamps! 

### An important project paves the way for a brighter future

These remote training courses have been delivered through several interactive sessions per week, for 12 weeks, since the start of January. They officially came to an end yesterday on Wednesday, March 31, and we've been delighted with how positive the experience has been all across the board.

These courses were completely free for people from our local community, as part of an important push to close the digital skills gap and help the UK economy begin to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

The project has also promoted greater diversity and equality within the tech industry, with over 50% of the trainees being female, as well as a large contingent coming from the BAME community and other under-represented groups.

This is a big step in the right direction, making career opportunities in tech equally available for everyone regardless of gender, race, or background. 

### Congratulations to our graduates

After 12 weeks of hard work, all the grads who have completed this training are now equipped with some of the most sought-after digital skills for employers in the current digital-first business landscape. 

The industry-led curriculum, hands-on learning, and community-driven support network provided by the project have all been very well received by everyone involved.

Gary Tate, a self-employed events co-ordinator by trade, decided to take the Web and App Development with JAMStack Bootcamp because the COVID-19 lockdowns put him in a position where he needed to make a career change. Gary said:

#### “The JAMstack Bootcamp has been amazing. I’ve really benefitted from how flexible the course is and being able to learn from home is a real advantage. I’ve loved the remote classes and being able to learn through Zoom has been great."

#### “The bootcamp is interactive and I’ve learnt so much from some incredible coaches. I’ve also really enjoyed connecting with other people, spending time with other students on Zoom calls, sharing screens and working collaboratively to solve problems together.”

Huge congratulations is in order for everyone who has taken part in this project. Everyone here at The Coders Guild has been so impressed with all the effort and hard work over the past few months.

Needless to say, massive thanks are also in order for our outstanding trainers and mentors for their help in making this project happen. We’re so lucky to have such a dedicated, experienced team of experts delivering this training with us. 

### A unique opportunity for employers

This project is a perfect example of how crucial digital skills training can be in unlocking the full potential of the tech industry in a post-pandemic world.

Suman Bala, QA Lead at Sky, who helped us teach the bootcamps, said: 

#### “I was amazed to see the learners’ aptitude and attitude. You can teach people skills, but you can’t teach them how to be passionate. The learners on these bootcamps have all been passionate, hardworking, and full of energy.”

#### “All of the learners on the Software Testing Bootcamp, for instance, now have a strong foundation of testing. They've come a long way, and I’m 100% sure they’ll be adding quality to any team they join with the tester’s mindset. I can’t wait to see them grow and shine in their testing careers, and I can highly recommend every single one of them!”

As of today, this new generation of future tech superstars are trained and ready to make an impact in their next roles.

### What comes next?

We’re excited to announce that this project has been so successful that we’ve now been given an extension to continue teaching right through to the summer. 

This is fantastic news, as it will allow us to continue making tech education more accessible, create more career opportunities within the local community, and provide businesses with the skills and qualities they need to thrive.

The extension is a testament to the amazing effort of this first round of participants, as well as the phenomenal work put in by the trainers and mentors.

### Thanks to all involved

It’s been a pleasure delivering this training for the WYCA and the Department for Education, and we’re looking forward to continuing that for new groups of participants over the coming weeks and months! 

By making digital skills training more easily available, we’re developing a brighter future for UK businesses and employees alike.
