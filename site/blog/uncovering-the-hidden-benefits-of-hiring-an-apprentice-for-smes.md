### How do apprenticeships work?

When your business hires an apprentice, they‚Äôll split their time between working in a certain role for you, whilst studying for a formal qualification related to that role. Apprenticeships are a fantastic way to build capacity in your workforce, and also to help people get the experience and skills they need to build a future career. 

Until recently, apprenticeships have been viewed as alternative routes into employment for young people leaving school. However, they‚Äôre now receiving much wider recognition for the career path they offer. In the near future, apprenticeships will be available to train to become anything from a software developer to a GP, with apprentices earning qualifications, getting practical experience, and making an income at the same time. 

In our industry, many companies we work with have told us they think apprenticeships are a preferable route into employment over studying full-time for a degree and then looking for a job. This is because competitive job roles - such as web and app development, for example - are increasingly looking for real-world skills that will allow them to do that job, over formal theory-based education. 

**Apprenticeships are not just for school leavers, as more and more adults are now becoming highly capable apprentices to make a career change.**

Over the past few years, apprenticeships have become increasingly common for people in higher age groups. In fact, [this time last year, 61.6% of all apprenticeship starts in the UK were by learners aged 25 and over](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/apprenticeships-and-traineeships/2019-20).

### Why should businesses consider apprenticeships?

You may think that taking on an apprentice developer is not worth the commitment or extra responsibility, as that‚Äôs a common misconception among SMEs. 

Yes, you‚Äôll need to onboard them, manage them, train them, and pay them, and you may not feel you can spare the time or the resources to do that. But many of those problems solve themselves when you gain a clear understanding how apprentices actually deliver a return on your investment fast. 

Apprenticeships have proven to be incredibly valuable investments for SMEs. They deliver the positive impact of having a talented new employee while bypassing many of the challenges associated with recruiting and onboarding more experienced new staff. 

Most notably, taking on an apprentice allows you to achieve the same benefits of gaining an additional team member at a significantly lower cost. **The government pays 95% of the apprenticeship training costs, and you‚Äôll also receive up to ¬£4,000 in additional funding for each apprentice you hire, making it a very cost-effective, worthwhile investment.**

Some of the other advantages an apprentice offers include: 

‚úÖ  A new team member who is more eager and more hungry to learn

‚úÖ  Cognitive diversity and a fresh perspective from someone with no bad habits 

‚úÖ  Someone trained in the specific skills, languages, and frameworks your team actually needs.

### The hidden benefits of hiring an apprentice

What you‚Äôll also find is that, once you‚Äôve gone through the experience of recruiting, hiring, and working with an apprentice for the first time, you‚Äôll begin to uncover a number of hidden benefits which add even greater value to their team as a whole. 

**The lesser know, often hidden benefits of hiring an apprentice for SMEs are:** 

üí°  **Better staff retention -** We‚Äôve found that apprentices who are successfully trained, and who have a positive experience within the business, end up becoming far more loyal. They often feel compelled to give back to the business that gave them their opportunity and invested in their development as an employee. 

It‚Äôs common that apprentices who pass their qualification and move into a permanent job tend to stick around for longer, whereas more experienced employees find it easier to jump from role to role chasing higher salaries.

üí°  **Existing members of your team will gain good managerial experience -** Often in smaller tech teams the best developer will get made into tech lead by default, regardless of their leadership or management qualities. 

Sometimes this is a bad fit for the team as a whole, sometimes this can create extra workload for someone who isn‚Äôt suited to it, and sometimes it can leave other employees with more management potential under-utilised. 

But having an apprentice will require different members of the team to take on leadership responsibilities. Not only is this good experience for them, but it can also uncover hidden skills and highlight new assets for your business moving forward.

üí°  **Existing members of your team will gain teaching and mentor experience -** A crucial part of an apprenticeship is learning on the job. This will create the opportunity for different members of your team to teach and mentor them. This gives your staff new perspectives on how to communicate with others, improve their own dev skills by teaching others, and even help them improve their fundamental skills by going back and re-learning things they don‚Äôt usually practice.

üí°  **It will free up time for your more talented employees -** Your most highly skilled employees are often the ones you pay the most, so you don‚Äôt want them wasting time on low-level tasks or admin. By introducing an apprentice into your team, it will free up time and ensure that your most talented developers are spending more time on more creative and challenging tasks. 

üí°  **Your team will improve core skills and greater cultural diversity -** Without getting caught up with the stereotype of a reclusive developer shut away in a quiet room writing code for hours on end, it‚Äôs undeniable that anyone who can bring enthusiasm and good communication skills into any working environment will be a valuable addition. An apprentice will bring new qualities to the business which will improve the team as a whole, as your existing team can then learn from the apprentice to improve their own core skills as well. 

It‚Äôs also becoming increasingly common for adults who are changing careers to go down the apprenticeship route. If you have someone with 10 years‚Äô experience in the retail sector, for example, joining your team as a developer apprentice, it‚Äôs inevitable that they‚Äôll bring transferable skills and fresh approaches in key areas like client relationship management. 

üí°  **It will encourage you to improve and bolster your documentation -** Most developers are notoriously bad at keeping documentation, but apprentices will need this to help their onboarding, allow them to follow the correct processes, and help them understand why things are done a certain way. 

This is a great incentive to update your documentation, which often gets ignored when you have an established and settled team. Once you have your full written processes in place, the apprentice can then be the one to make sure that your standards for documentation are maintained and everything is kept up-to-date moving forward. 

üí°  **It will encourage your team to follow processes and best practices -** Similar to what we said above, by having a new team member who is learning from scratch, your other devs will need to make extra effort to stop taking risky shortcuts and stick to the script more often. This is important as your apprentice will need to learn how to do things properly based on best practices and follow the correct processes.

This is a great chance to ensure your code standards are being followed, your devs are logging commit messages in the proper format, that commenting code is being used properly, and so on. If the apprentice is doing these things then the rest of the team will naturally follow suit. 

### Is hiring an apprentice right for you?

These are the kind of things that we rarely have time to actively work on, or even think about, but when they all begin to fall into place they can have an enormous positive impact on the efficiency and quality of your team‚Äôs work. 

You‚Äôll likely appreciate that you simply don‚Äôt have the time or headspace to proactively address all these gaps. Bringing in an apprentice is an excellent way to not only address them, but ensure they are filled for the long-term.
