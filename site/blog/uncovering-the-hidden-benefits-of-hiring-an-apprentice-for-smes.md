#### There are many well-known advantages to be gained by small and medium-sized businesses from hiring an apprentice developer, but there are also plenty of hidden benefits which only begin to take shape once you actually start working with one yourself. In this article, weâ€™ll uncover some of the lesser known benefits that can be achieved by hiring an apprentice for SMEs. 

### TL;DR 

*If youâ€™re in a hurry, the seven hidden benefits that a developer apprentice can create for SMEs are:*

*Better staff retention, existing staff gaining managerial experience, existing staff gaining teaching and mentoring experience, freeing up time for more talented developers, greater team culture, improved documentation, and more reason to follow best practices.*

*But make sure to come back and read more about how each one can have a significant positive impact on your own team when you have more time!* 

### How do apprenticeships work?

An apprenticeship is essentially an arrangement where your business hires someone who will split their time between working in a certain role for you, while theyâ€™re simultaneously studying for a formal qualification related to that role or a future career path.  

Apprenticeships have traditionally been viewed as alternative routes into employment for young people who donâ€™t want to - or are unable to - go to university. However, these days, theyâ€™re becoming far more common for people of all ages and backgrounds looking to study for a qualification whilst gaining practical experience within a business. 

Many now see apprenticeships as a preferable route to take into employment, rather than studying full-time for a degree. This is because competitive job roles - such as web and app development, for example - are increasingly looking for real-world skills that will allow them to do that job, over formal theory-based education. 

And apprenticeships are no longer just for school leavers, as more and more adults are now becoming highly capable apprentices in order to make a career change.

In fact, over the past few years, apprenticeships have become increasingly common for people in higher age groups. [In 2018/19 this trend rose significantly, when 46% of the apprenticeships started were by people aged 25](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06113/#:~:text=46%25%20of%20the%20apprenticeships%20started,starts%20than%20in%202017%2F18.). And the age group with the largest increase at that time was those aged between 35 and 44, with 21% more than in the previous year.

### Why should businesses consider apprenticeships? 

You may think itâ€™s not worth the commitment and extra responsibility of taking on a developer apprentice. Yes, youâ€™ll need to onboard them, manage them, train them, and pay them, and you may not feel you can spare the time or the resources to do so. 

But many of those problems solve themselves when you understand how apprenticeships actually work. Apprenticeships have proven to be incredibly valuable investments for SMEs, because they deliver the positive impact of having a talented new employee while bypassing many of the challenges associated with recruiting and onboarding more experienced new staff. 

Most notably, taking on an apprentice allows you to achieve the same benefits of gaining an additional team member at a significantly lower cost. **The government pays 95% of the apprenticeship training costs, and youâ€™ll also receive up to Â£4,000 in additional funding for each apprentice you hire, making it a very cost-effective, worthwhile investment.**

Some of the other advantages an apprentice offers are: 

\    âœ…  A new team member who is more eager and more hungry to learn

\    âœ…  Cognitive diversity and a fresh perspective from someone with no bad habits 

\    âœ…  Someone trained in the specific skills, languages, and frameworks your team actually needs.

### The hidden benefits of hiring an apprentice

What youâ€™ll also find is that, once youâ€™ve gone through the experience of recruiting, hiring, and working with an apprentice for the first time, youâ€™ll begin to uncover a number of hidden benefits which add even greater value to their team as a whole. 

##### The lesser known, hidden benefits of hiring an apprentice for SMEs are:

\    ðŸ’¡  **Better staff retention -** Weâ€™ve found that apprentices who are successfully trained, and who have a positive experience within the business, end up becoming far more loyal. They often feel compelled to give back to the business that gave them their opportunity and invested in their development as an employee. 

Itâ€™s common that apprentices who pass their qualification and move into a permanent job tend to stick around for longer, whereas more experienced employees find it easier to jump from role to role chasing higher salaries.

\    ðŸ’¡  **Existing members of your team will gain good managerial experience -** Often in smaller tech teams the best developer will get made into tech lead by default, regardless of their leadership or management qualities. 
Sometimes this is a bad fit for the team as a whole, sometimes this can create extra workload for someone who isnâ€™t suited to it, and sometimes it can leave other employees with more management potential under-utilised. 

But having an apprentice will require different members of the team to take on leadership responsibilities. Not only is this good experience for them, but it can also uncover hidden skills and highlight new assets for your business moving forward.

ðŸ’¡  **Existing members of your team will gain teaching and mentor experience -** A crucial part of an apprenticeship is learning on the job. This will create the opportunity for different members of your team to teach and mentor them. This, in-turn, will provide your staff with new perspectives on how to communicate with others, improve their own dev skills by teaching others, and even help them improve their fundamental skills by going back and re-learning things they donâ€™t usually practice.

ðŸ’¡  **It will free up time for your more talented employees -** Your most highly skilled employees are often the ones you pay the most, so you donâ€™t want them wasting time on low-level tasks or admin. By introducing an apprentice into your team, it will free up time and ensure that your most talented developers are spending more time on more creative and challenging tasks. 

ðŸ’¡  **Your team will improve core skills and greater cultural diversity -** Without getting caught up with the stereotype of a reclusive developer shut away in a quiet room writing code for hours on end, itâ€™s undeniable that anyone who can bring enthusiasm and good communication skills into any working environment will be a valuable addition. An apprentice will bring new qualities to the business which will improve the team as a whole, as your existing team can then learn from the apprentice to improve their own core skills as well. 

Additionally, itâ€™s becoming increasingly common for adults who are changing careers to go down the apprenticeship route. If you have someone with 10 yearsâ€™ experience in the retail sector, for example, joining your team as a developer apprentice, itâ€™s inevitable that theyâ€™ll bring transferable skills and fresh approaches in key areas like client relationship management. 

ðŸ’¡  **It will encourage you to improve and bolster your documentation -** Most developers are notoriously bad at keeping documentation, but apprentices will need this to help their onboarding, allow them to follow the correct processes, and help them understand why things are done a certain way. 

This is a great incentive to update your documentation, which often gets ignored when you have an established and settled team. Once you have your full written processes in place, the apprentice can then be the one to make sure that your standards for documentation are maintained and everything is kept up-to-date moving forward. 

ðŸ’¡  **It will encourage your team to follow processes and best practices -** Similar to the above point, by having a new team member who is learning from scratch, your other devs will need to make extra effort to stop taking risky shortcuts and stick to the script more often. This is important as your apprentice will need to learn how to do things properly based on best practices and follow the correct processes.

This is a great chance to ensure your code standards are being followed, your devs are logging commit messages in the proper format, that commenting code is being used properly, and so on. If the apprentice is doing these things then the rest of the team will naturally follow suit. 

These are the kind of things that we rarely have time to actively work on, or even think about, but when they all begin to fall into place they can have an enormous positive impact on the efficiency and quality of your teamâ€™s work. 

Youâ€™ll likely appreciate that you simply donâ€™t have the time or headspace to proactively address all these gaps. Bringing in an apprentice is an excellent way to not only address them, but ensure they are filled for the long-term.
