## Why You Need to Apply

Now more than ever, digital skills training is a great way to open up new opportunities, and give yourself a better chance of enjoying a long, successful career in a digital-first world.

That’s why the government is investing £2.5 billion for the National Skills Fund through the Department for Education, and The Coders Guild is excited to announce that we’ll be a part of this programme. 

Working in partnership with the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA), we’re providing FREE training courses to help people in the local area gain valuable, relevant digital skills, and support you in realising your full potential for a brighter future. 

We have a long list of businesses of all shapes and sizes across West Yorkshire who are actively looking to hire talented people like you through this programme, with the number of UX jobs set to rise significantly in 2021.

In addition to direct access to those employers, participants on this course will also come away with: 

* Coaching in modern employability skills, and guidance through UX role-specific hiring processes
* Invitations to employer engagement events, and help finding a job where you can use the UX design skills you’ll have learned 
* A high-demand digital skill-set needed by employers today across almost every industry and sector

## What You’ll Learn

You’ve probably heard the term “UX" before, but what does it really mean?  

This is your chance to learn not just what UX is all about, but also how to design a great UX yourself, and make this part of your future career path. 

![User Experience (UX) Vs User Interface Design (UI) UX is things like objectives, research, testing, usability, personas - UI design is interaction, layouts, colour, graphics, typography](/images/blog/ux-ui.png)

UX is all about interacting directly with people who use digital products like mobile apps now, to create better technology for the future, and this course will teach you the skills to do exactly that.

You’ll learn about user experience as well as customer experience, plus the principles of accessibility and usability. You’ll also learn about researching, planning, testing, and the measurement of technology. This will allow you to see how we actually know whether something works well, whether it needs to be improved, and the best ways to improve it. 

You’ll gain a full understanding of how we design and develop better digital services, features, and products, and deliver more value to users, customers, and clients as a result!

Being well-versed in great UX design is a skill-set which is in high demand among employers right now, and that demand is only set to continue rising in 2021 and beyond.
